## About the Project

This project is a collection of bash scripts that I've created for various
purposes. The scripts are organized into directories based on their functionality
or purpose. Here are some of the directories you'll find in this repository:

- **automation**: Scripts for automating repetitive tasks or workflows
- **backup**: Scripts for backing up files, directories, or databases
- **data-processing**: Scripts for processing data, such as CSV files or logs
- **networking**: Scripts for network-related tasks, such as pinging or checking ports
- **system-management**: Scripts for managing system resources, services, or configurations
- **utilities**: General-purpose utility scripts for various tasks
- **system-config**: Scripts for configuring system settings or preferences

Each script is well-documented with comments to explain its purpose, usage, and
implementation. You can explore the scripts to see how they work and modify them
for your needs. If a folder doesn't exist for the type of script you want to
contribute, feel free to create a new one and add your scripts there.
